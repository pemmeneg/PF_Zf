\subsection{External Iterator}
\subsubsection{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iteration through a collection depends on the target implementation
    \item Separate logic of iteration into an object to allow multiple iteration strategies
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Intent:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can strong coupling between iteration and collection be avoided, generalized and provided in a collection-optimized manner?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Solution}
Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.\\

\textbf{Elementary operations of an Iterator's behaviour:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Initializing an iteration \textit{new ArrayList().iterator();}
    \item Checking a completion condition \textit{it.hasNext();}
    \item Accessing a current target value \textit{var x = it.next();}
    \item Moving to the next target value \textit{it.next();}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Summary}
\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provides a single interface to loop though any kind of collection
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Liabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multiple iterators may loop through a collection at the same time
    \item Life-Cycle Management of iterator objects
    \item Close coupling between Iterator and Collection class
    \item Indexing might be more intuitive for programmers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enumeration Method}
\subsubsection{Problem:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Iteration management is performed by the collection's user
    \item Avoid state management between collection and iteration
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Intent:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can a collection be iterated considering the collection state and furthermore state management be reduced?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Solution}
Support encapsulated iteration over a collection by placing responsibility for iteration in a method on the collection. The method takes a Command object that is applied to the elements of the collection.\\

\subsubsection{Summary}
Programming languages already implement Enumeration Method as their loop construct. (e.g. \textit{.forEach()})\\ 
\textbf{Benefits:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Client is not responsible for loop housekeeping details
    \item Synchronization can be provided at the level of the whole traversal rather than for each element access
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Liabilities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Functional approach, more complex syntax needed
    \item Often considered too abstract for programmers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Batch Method}
\subsubsection{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collection and client (iterator user) are not on the same machine
    \item Operation invocations are no longer trivial
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Intent:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can a collection be iterated over multiple tiers without spending far more time in communication than in computation?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Solution}
Group multiple collection accesses together to reduce the cost of multiple individual accesses in a distributed environment.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define a data structure which groups interface calls on client side
    \item Provide an interface on servant to access groups of elements at once
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objects for State}
\subsubsection{Problem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Object's behaviour depends on its state, and it must change its behaviour at run-time
    \item Operations have large, multipart conditional statements (Flags) that depend on the state
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Intent:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How can an object act according to its state without multipart conditional statements?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Solution}
Allow an object to alter its behaviour when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
