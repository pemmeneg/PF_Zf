\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Pattern Definition}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Descriptions of successful engineering stories
    \item Address recurring problem
    \item Descripe generic solution that worked
    \item Tell about the forces of the problem (why is the problem hard)
    \item Tell about the engineering trade-offs  to take (Benefits / Liabilities)
    \item Solution (Implementation)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Type of Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Architecture Patterns (Waiting Room)
    \item Software Patterns
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Design Pattern (Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Sofware)
        \item Pattern-oriented Software Architecture (POSA)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Organizational Patterns
    \item Learning and Teaching Patterns
    \item Documentation Patterns
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pattern Formats}
\subsubsection{POSA}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pattern name
    \item Intent
    \item Problem
    \item Solution
    \item Benefits / Liabilities
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Fault Tolerance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name
    \item Intent
    \item Solution
    \item Benefits / Liabilities
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{MAPI}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name
    \item Intent
    \item Consequences
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Game Programming Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Name
    \item Problem
    \item Engineering Story that worked
    \item Benefits / Liabilities
    \item Solution
\end{itemize}

\subsection{What are Patterns not?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Silver bullet
    \item Novices Tool
    \item Ready Made Components
    \item Means to turn off your brain
\end{itemize}
